            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there, welcome to my portfolio!
            I'm someone who genuinely loves creating things—especially when it comes to
            web development. It's where I pour in all my curiosity and passion.
            With a background in Computer Science and Engineering, I enjoy working on projects
            that make life a little easier for users, especially when it comes to how they 
            connect and communicate with businesses. I’m always excited to learn something new
            and bring ideas to life in a way that feels meaningful and user-friendly. 
            </p>
